    <p> <h3>What Is The Push/Pull/Legs Split Routine?</h3></p>
    <br>
    <p> <strong>The push/pull/legs split is a very simple training method in which you split your body into three parts. And each part is then trained on its own separate day.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>In the “push” workout you train all the upper body pushing muscles, i.e. the chest, shoulders and triceps.</strong></p>  
  <p><strong>In the “pull” workout you train all the upper body pulling muscles, i.e. the back and biceps.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>And in the “legs” workout you train the entire lower body, i.e. the quads, hamstrings, calves and abdominals.</strong></p>
  <br>
  <br>
 
  <p><h3>Why Use A Push/Pull/Legs Split?</h3></p>
<br>
<p>The push/pull/legs split is probably the most efficient workout split there is because all related muscle groups are trained together in the same workout.</p>
<p>This means that you get the maximum overlap of movements within the same workout, and the muscle groups being trained get an overall benefit from this overlap.</p>
<p>For example when you train chest with say bench press, you are also hitting your anterior deltoids and triceps hard. And when you train shoulders you are again involving your triceps. So it makes sense to work these all together in the same workout for maximum synergy and effectiveness.</p>
<p>Similarly when you train your back your biceps are heavily involved, so it again makes sense to train these immediately afterwards so that they can derive the maximum benefit from the additional stimulation.</p>  
<p>It also means you will have minimum overlap of movements between workouts, and this will facilitate better recovery than most other body part splits.</p>  
<br>
<br>

<p><h3>Who Should Use A Push/Pull/Legs Split?</h3></p>
<br>
<p>The push/pull/legs split is ideal for both the intermediate and advanced trainee.</p>
<p> More specifically though, if you are just starting out or have not had much in the way of results from your efforts so far, you’ll almost certainly do best with a full body workout routine, training three days per week. Stick with this for at least six months – more if you are still progressing well.</p>
<p>Once you hit the intermediate stage however you’ll probably find you’ll do better with an upper/lower split routine training three or four days per week. And this is in fact one of the best ways to train for the vast majority of the population.</p>
<p>But at any time past the beginner stage you may find the push/pull/legs split suits you better. Or you may wish to alternate upper/lower splits with a push/pull/legs split in order to derive all the benefits that each has to offer.</p>
<p>Either way the push/pull/legs split is an extremely effective method of training that is certain to give you exceptional results if you apply yourself to it diligently</p>
